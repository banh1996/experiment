1.  Let result(k, q) (k = 1..m, q = 1..n) be a maximum weigth from (1, 1) -> (k, q) in G
    The final result is result(m,n) Use dynamic programing, 

Start at (i, j), init result(..) = negative infinity

while (still can move)
    result(i+1, j) = max(result(i+1, j) , result(i, j) + w(i+1, j))
    if result(i+1, j) = result(i, j) + w(i+1, j) then  trace(i+1, j) = (i,j)
    
    result(i, j+1) = max(result(i, j+1) , result(i, j) + w(i, j+1))
    if result(i, j+1) = result(i, j) + w(i, j+1) then  trace(i, j+1) = (i,j)

    result(i+1, j+1) = max(result(i+1, j+1) , result(i, j) + w(i+1, j+1))
    if result(i+1, j+1) = result(i, j) + w(i+1, j+1) then  trace(i+1, j+1) = (i,j)

result(m, n) is the maximum weigth from (1, 1) -> (m, n),
print trace(m, n) ... (1,1)

complexity time: O(mn)

2. Prove that P is closed under the star operation by dynamic programming.

    Let A ∈ P. We want to show that A* ∈ P. Since A ∈ P there exists a deterministic Turing machine MA
with time complexity O(n^k) for some k >= 0.
    We now build, using MA, a deterministic decider for A* and show that its time complexity is bounded
by a polynomial. The central observation in our construction is that w ∈ A* if and only if one of the
following conditions is true
    w = ε, or
    w ∈ A, or
    ∃u, v : w = uv and u ∈ A* and v ∈ A*

    In the decider described below we let wi,j denote the substring of w = w1, w2, ... wn starting with wi
and ending with wj . The decider builds a table where table(i, j) = true if wi,j ∈ A*. We do this by considering
all substrings of w starting with substrings of length 1 and ending with the substring of length n.

On input w = w1, w2 . . . wn:

If w = ε then accept
Else
For l := 1 to n
    For i := 1 to n − (l − 1)
        j := i + l − 1
        Run MA on wi,j
            If MA accepts wi,j then table(i, j) := true
            Else
                For k := i to j − 1
                If table(i, k) = true and table(k + 1, j) = true
                then table(i, j) := true
If table(1, n) = true then accept
Else
    reject

    We now analyze the complexity of our decider. The algorithm uses three nested loops, each of which
can be traversed at most O(n) times. In the second loop we run MA on an input of length at most n, so the
total time is at most O(n).O(n).(O(n^k) + O(n)) = O(n^(2+(max(k,1)))).


3. A triangle in an undirected graph G is defined to be a 3-clique (i.e., three vertices in G
that are pairwise connected by edges) and 3-ANGLE := {<G> | G contains a triangle .
Prove that 3-ANGLE ∈ P.

    Let G = (V, E) be a graph with a set V of vertices and a set E of edges.
We list all vertices (u, v, w) with u, v, w ∈ V and u < v < w, then
check whether or not all three edges (u, v), (v, w) and (u, w) exist in E. Enumeration
of all triples requires O(|V|^3) time. Checking whether or not all three edges belong
to E takes O(|E|) time. Thus, the overall time is O(|V|^3 |E|), which is polynomial
in the length of the input <G>. Therefore, TRIANGLE ∈ P

4. Prove that if P = NP, then we can factor integers in polynomial time.

Consider the language:
    L = {<n, a, b>|n has a factor p in the range a <= p <= b}
    L is obviously in NP, since the factor can serve as the certificate.
    Since we’re assuming P=NP, there is a polynomial algorithm that decides
the above language.
    Repeated applications of the algorithm allow us to divide our search space
in half each time by asking "Is there a factor in the range (a, a + b/2)?"
If there isn’t we know there is a factor in the other range.
    The total number of times we have to apply the algorithm is equal to lg n,
or in other words O(k) if k is the number of bits of n. So a polynomial
number of applications of this algorithm allows us to isolate one factor.
    Since there are at most O(k) factors as well (the maximum number of
factors occuring when n is simply a product of 2s), we can find all the
factors in polynomial time.
