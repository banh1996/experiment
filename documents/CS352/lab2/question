Note: Your homework must be typed. Handwritten text will receive 0 points, diagrams can be hand drawn. Show your calculations.

1. (10 points) What is the purpose of interrupts? What is a trap? Can traps be generated intentionally by a user program? If so, for what purpose?

2. (10 points) Describe the dual-mode operation of CPU. What is the reason to distinguish between the two modes?

3. (10 points) Which of the following instructions should be privileged?
a. Set value of timer
b. Read the clock
c. Clear memory
d. Issue a trap instruction
e. Turn off interrupts
f. Put the CPU in kernel mode
g. Access I/O device

4. (10 points) A computer has a CPU that executes at 1GHz (1 billion cycles per second).

The data sheet for a SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) device controller says the maximum transfer speed is 100Mbps (100 million bits per second) and the maximum buffer size is 4096 bytes. A high-frequency 6-axis accelerometer/gyroscope sensor is connected by an external cable to the SPI controller and sends a 20 byte data packet every 10 Î¼s. Every time a complete data packet is received by the controller it signals an interrupt to the CPU.

A device driver has been written for the SPI controller, it has an ISR (interrupt service routine, aka interrupt handler) that can transfer a 20 byte data packet into main memory for later processing in about 100 CPU cycles.

What percentage of CPU cycles will be used transferring data from the controller to main memory? Your answer should be in the form of a percentage (e.g. 20% of CPU cycles).

5. (10 points) Three programs are serviced in a multiprogramming system. Program 1 contains 50ms of computation followed by 100ms of I/O on device 1. Program 2 contains 20ms of computation followed by 50ms of I/O on device 1. Program 3 contains 50ms of computation followed by 100ms I/O on device 2. How long it will take to complete all three programs? Draw a diagram similar to the one given in the lecture notes to show the operation of the three programs. (A device can service one I/O request at a time.)

6. (10 points) Describe why DMA is considered a more efficient mechanism for performing I/O than interrupt-driven I/O.

7. (10 points) Describe three general methods for passing parameters to the operating system.
