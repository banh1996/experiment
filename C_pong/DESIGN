Struct:
    eDir: STOP, UPLEFT, DOWNLEFT, UPRIGHT, DOWNRIGHT, DOWN, UP
    
    ball_t:
    {
        eDir dir;
        int x, y; //coordinates
    }

    paddle_t:
    {
        eDir dir;
        int x, y; //coordinates
    }

    wall_t:
    {
        int offset_x, offset_y, len_x, len_y; //coordinates and length of wall
        uint64_t clk; //save the start time
    }

Flow:
    loop:
        if count >= speed
            check game_rules (ball reaches wall, paddle, out of court)
            increase speed if ball reaches paddle
            move_ball (direct)
        check keyboard input
        if (input = k/m)
            move paddle (direct)
        if (input = Q)
            quit
        display current time
        increase count by 1
        sleep 10us

Special Topic: Race Condition
    To draw ball, paddle or time at the same time, I used count variable as speed.
    In my source code, delay 10us and count (about 1000-1200), so the speed is 10*count (us),
    time clock in my code is 10us. each clock, program executes functions such as move_paddle, check keyboard input, print,....
    And after 10*count clock, program executes move_ball funtion and resets count.

Special Topic: Elaspsed Time Clock
    every clock, program prints the time, make sure clock tick is less than 1s(In my case is 10us).
    So, the display time will be updated every 10 microsecond.
