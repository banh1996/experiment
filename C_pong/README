Special Topic: Race Condition
    To draw ball, paddle or time at the same time, I used count variable as speed.
    In my source code, delay 10us and count (about 1000-1200), so the speed is 10*count (us),
    time clock in my code is 10us. each clock, program executes functions such as move_paddle, check keyboard input, print,....
    And after 10*count clock, program executes move_ball funtion and resets count.

Special Topic: Elaspsed Time Clock
    every clock, program prints the time, be sure clock tick is less than 1s.
